Dimson et al. provide a solid and helpful introduction ^[The work of Dimson et al. was regularly updated. The 2009 edition is the most recent version available] to world's stock markets and the question of returns [@dimson2009triumph].
Ritter finds that cross-country correlation of real stock returns and per capita GDP growth over 1900-2002 is negative which is mainly traced back to the fact that increases in capital and labor inputs (i.e. two main determinants of economic growth) in new corporations (i.e. representing innovation) do not necessarily imply higher dividends [@ritter2005economic].
